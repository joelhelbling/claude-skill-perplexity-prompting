# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for developing a Claude Skill that teaches effective Perplexity querying using the official Perplexity MCP server.

## Repository Structure

- `skill.md` - The actual skill definition (to be created)
- `sources/` - Reference materials for skill development
  - `nate-b-jones-master-perplexity-prompting.md` - Expert Perplexity prompting strategies
  - `installing-perplexity-mcp-server.md` - MCP server setup documentation

## Development Notes

This is a documentation-only project with no build system, tests, or code to run. Development consists of:

1. Researching Perplexity usage patterns from source materials
2. Writing and refining the skill.md file
3. Maintaining reference documentation

## Skill Format

Claude Skills are markdown files that provide instructions to Claude. The skill should reference the Perplexity MCP tools (`perplexity_ask`, `perplexity_research`, `perplexity_reason`, `perplexity_search`) and teach when and how to use them effectively.
